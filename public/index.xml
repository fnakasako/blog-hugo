      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was played with sentences, trying to create my own brand of non-fiction on the spot that would make sense for a blog (the majority of the non-fiction that I have written in my life has been journal entries), I circled back to a familiar device for uncertainty: &amp;ldquo;What do I wish existed?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that the kinds of questions that I usually use this device for do not have overtly constraining parameters. For example, when I think to myself what book, or what software do I wish existed, parameters are more or less irrelevant. When trying to apply this to my own life, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to ask myself &amp;lsquo;what person do I wish existed,&amp;rsquo; for I can&amp;rsquo;t become anyone who I dream up. I have to define myself in the context of the given parameters: my upbringing, my familial story, etc. When framed like this, the question becomes much harder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
