      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I played with sentences, trying to create my own brand of non-fiction that would make sense for a blog (the majority of the non-fiction that I have written in my life has been journal entries), I circled back to a familiar question: “What do I wish existed?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that this question usually does not come with overtly constraining parameters. For example, when I think to myself what book, or software I wish existed, parameters are essentially irrelevant. When applying this to my own life, it does not make sense to ask myself ‘what person do I wish existed.” I have to define myself in the context of given parameters: my upbringing, my familial story, etc. When framed like this, the question becomes much harder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
